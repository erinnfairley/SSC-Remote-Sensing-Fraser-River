# Predicting SSC and its Relationship with Discharge using Google Earth Engine Landsat 5 of the Fraser River, BC Canada
## In this project, a Python API-based analysis is executed using the USGS Landsat 5 Level 2, Collection 2, Tier 1 dataset by extracting surface reflectance values from the green, red, and near-infrared bands. The band values are then used in a multiple regression analysis to determine a potential relationship between surface reflectance and suspended sediment concentration (SSC). Real, daily SSC data is obtained through Environment Canada to calibrate the model. The model is then applied to the Landsat 5 band values to determine how well the model predicts SSC. Scatter, time series, and histogram plots are generated to explore this model and its weaknesses. Daily discharge is also obtained through Environment Canada, and a relationship between SSC and discharge is then explored, and the predicted SSC data is used to determine if this method can be applied in instances where real SSC data is unavailable.
